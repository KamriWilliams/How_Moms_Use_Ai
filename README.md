<h1>Overview</h1>

This project analyzes real feedback from moms about how they use (or avoid) AI in their day-to-day lives. The goal is to uncover patterns in behavior, identify key needs and frustrations, and build personas that represent the major types of AI users within the mom community.

<h3> Why This Matters</h3>

Mothers manage a wide mix of responsibilities — parenting, partnerships, school, career, entrepreneurship, and household management. Their needs and expectations around AI naturally vary.

Understanding these needs helps reveal:

- Where AI tools truly help
- Where they overwhelm or fall short
- How to design more supportive, inclusive AI experiences

<h3>Dataset</h3>

The dataset includes qualitative responses from moms describing:

- Daily AI habits
- Use of AI for personal tasks
- Use of AI in supporting children
- Trust level, concerns, and hesitations
- Barriers to adoption (time, confidence, privacy)
- (Dataset not published publicly for privacy reasons.)

<h3>Methodology</h3>

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Keyword extraction and topic grouping
- Behavior clustering (qualitative + lightweight NLP)
- Persona creation based on shared patterns
- Insights and recommendations for AI design

<h3>Personas Identified</h3>


<h3>Key Insights</h3>

- Time-pressed moms adopt AI faster.
- Comfort with AI increases when they’ve used it at work or school.
-  Privacy concerns and overwhelm are the biggest blockers.
- Moms want AI tools that feel simple, trustworthy, and personalized.
- Opportunities for Better AI Tools
- Reduce mental load through proactive suggestions
- Kid-specific, developmentally aligned AI support
- Clear examples showing “how to use it” instead of open-ended prompts
- More culturally inclusive AI experiences

Next Steps

- Expand dataset with more demographics
- Add sentiment analysis
- Quantify clusters using structured survey data
- Build persona cards and visual summaries
